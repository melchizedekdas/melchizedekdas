I am Melchizedek Das.
I am an experienced software developer with a master's degree in Computer Science from NITK, Surathkal. I have strong professional experience designing and developing cloud platform, machine learning platform and back-end of web applications with limited experience designing and developing desktop applications and front-end of web applications. My primary interest is research and development in systems software. I scored 99.5 percentile in GATE CS 2018. Building software has been my passion since my childhood and I developed my first animated game in Java at the age of 15.
